Description: Methods and classes for strainmeter data.
    Currently, supported instruments
    include UCSD-style longbase
    laser strainmeters, and PBO-style borehole **strainmeters**.
    Support for PBO-style pore pressure data \textbf{is}
    included. Some functions  providing metadata \textit{support}
    attempt to make a _connection_
    with the `pborepo'.
    For processing of raw data, the user is directed to
    Duncan Agnew's `PIASD'
    and John Langbein's `cleanstrain+'
