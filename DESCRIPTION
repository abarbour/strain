Description: Methods and classes for strainmeter data.
    Currently, supported instruments include UCSD-style longbase
    laser strainmeters, and Network of the Americas (NOTA)-style 
    borehole strainmeters. Some support for NOTA pore pressure data is
    included. Some functions  providing metadata support
    attempt to make a connection with the 'pborepo'.
