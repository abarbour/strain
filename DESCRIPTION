Description: Methods and classes for strainmeter data.
    Currently, supported instruments include UCSD-style longbase
    laser strainmeters, and PBO-style borehole strainmeters. Support for
    PBO-style pore pressure data is
    included. Some functions  providing metadata support
    attempt to make a connection with the 'pborepo'.
    For processing of raw data, the user is directed to
    Duncan Agnew's 'PIASD'
    and John Langbein's 'cleanstrain+' (see 'URL' section).
