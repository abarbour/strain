SystemRequirements: awk, csh, python (>= 2.3)
URL: http://abarbour.github.io/strain/ (dev) and
    http://abarbour.github.io/pborepo for metadata.
    For processing of raw data,
    PIASD: http://igppweb.ucsd.edu/~agnew/Piasd/piasdmain.html
    and
    cleanstrain+: http://earthquake.usgs.gov/monitoring/edm/cleanstrain
    are commonly used tools.
Description: Methods and classes for strainmeter data.
    Currently, supported instruments include UCSD-style longbase
    laser strainmeters, and PBO-style borehole strainmeters. Support for
    PBO-style pore pressure data is
    included. Some functions  providing metadata support
    attempt to make a connection with the `pborepo'.
    For processing of raw data, the user is directed to
    Duncan Agnew's `PIASD'
    and John Langbein's `cleanstrain+' (see `URL' section).
